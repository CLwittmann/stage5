When set up, the riser's dimensions are 6 feet wide by 56 inches deep; when folded for storage, the riser measures at only 2 feet wide.

                    <h4>August 9, 2019</h4>
			 	    <p>In response to ever-growing concerns for the environment and consumer avidity for eco- friendly products, U.S Green Building Council member Stage 5 Staging, is proud to announce that its products are "going green" on a large scale. This change will take place both on the Staging side of the business and in the Railing Concepts division.<br><br>

Over the past two years Stage 5 Staging has been progressively adding eco-friendly materials to product lines. With a newly found source for obtaining recycled aluminum have increased its contributions to green building substantially. The ability to incorporate recycled aluminum into the new Railing Concepts division's product line will allow for a much needed boost to recycled content contributions in the ornamental railing market. The Railing Concepts division is excited that it has the opportunity to be the first of its kind to offer eco-friendly products to stadiums, arenas, and other major venues around the country.<br><br>

With the help of its cost-conscious estimating team, innovative designs and an increase in its own scrap reclaim, Stage 5 Staging has been able to make this change with no added costs to its products, leaving its customers and end users with a product that is as economically and environmentally mindful as possible.

			 	    <h3>Stage 5 Staging Equipment Adds Thousands of Seats to NCAA Tournament</h3>
                    <img src="img/news/ncaa-tournament.jpg
" alt="Choral Riser" title="NCAA">
                    <h4>October 6, 2019</h4>
			 	    <p>Thanks to a new NCAA-approved seating configuration with custom seating riser installations from Stage 5 Staging, thousands of additional fans were able to attend the NCAA Basketball Tournament in Detroit and Houston on March 28th and 30th. This new and enhanced seating configuration involved a major dramatic move of the basketball court from the end zone to the middle of the arena, giving thousands of fans — primarily students — a chance to be near the action.<br><br>

Almost 4,000 portable platforms were used for this year's Sweet Sixteen tournament. The installations are to also be used at the Final Four Tournaments in 2009 and 2011, scheduled for Ford Field in Detroit and Reliant Stadium in Houston, respectively. In the course of two days, Ford Field was expected to exceed 105,000* in paid attendance, which places it as the top regional site of all time. NCAA officials estimate that the expansive seating configuration will provide the NCAA with $4 million* in additional revenue, while enhancing the collegiate atmosphere with thousands of loyal students in the new sections' seating, cheering on their teams.<br><br>
"We were very pleased to be selected as the preferred vendor by the NCAA and The Colonnade Group for this prestigious event," said Michael Boland, President/CEO of Stage 5 Staging.
The new configuration consists of Stage 5 Staging' SC450 Single Sided Platforms that are supported by the SC6700 Bridge Support System and SC120 Folding Supports. Once assembled, the installation added 15,000* seats to Ford Field and 10,000* seats to Reliant Stadium.
